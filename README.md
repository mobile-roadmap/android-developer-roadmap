**Para a versão em português, [clique aqui](./README_PT_BR.md)**

Based on the [Developer Roadmap](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap) that help web developers with a path of what to learn on this extense area, we developed the Android Developer Roadmap with the same goal.

We hope that with this roadmap new developers find it easier to start building beautiful android applications.

## How to read

This content is a suggested learning path to help to guide you with your Android studies. To use this content, have in mind that the roadmap have macro boxes, that are in the middle (following the line path), and from them we have micro boxes, that are more refined content about the topic of the parent box.

So, in this way, we suggest you to read from the macro to the micro boxes, from up to bottom direction. This is how we thought about have a roadmap flow, in terms of needs and difficulties.

In addiction, is good to know that you don't need to know everything in the image bellow to be a good Android developer. You can follow your needs (in your studies, projects, etc) and it will be ok!

Remind that this is a collaborative content, so, if something is missing or incomplete, you must think about how to improve it for the community.
